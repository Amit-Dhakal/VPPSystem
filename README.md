# VPPSystem
# üîå Virtual Power Plant (VPP) Aggregator System ‚Äì REST API with Spring Boot


This project implements a RESTful API system for managing a **Virtual Power Plant (VPP)**.
The VPP aggregates distributed battery resources, allowing small-scale energy contributors 
to operate collectively as a single power provider.

## üöÄ Getting Started


## Architectural Design

- Spring Boot Application for minimal configuration requirements,Embedded tomcatserver and production ready features 
  like Health metrics checkup,Logging & Tracing support,Externalized configuration.
- Choosen Monoloithic Application over Microservice because of Simple and Faster development,Lower complexities for inter service communication,Single codebase,Easier Testing & Deployment.
- MVC Architecture more readable and maintainable,seperate business logic,Easier to test and debug.
- Used MYSQL Database because of light weight,less complexity on setup,and Faster for Read heavy and simple write operations.

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- Java 17+
- Maven 3.8.1
- MySQL 8.0
- Docker (for test cases)
- Github
